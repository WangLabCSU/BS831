## Loading the DrugMatrix Data

Loading data for the classification task. We will be using the
10-chemical subset of the DrugMatrix dataset, and aim to predict the
chemicals' carcinogenicity status.

```{r load_data}
data(dm10)

## DrugMatrix dataset 10 drugs/10 controls
DM <- dm10
## show chemicals and their numbers
table(pData(DM)[,"CHEMICAL"])
## show carcinogenicity status
table(pData(DM)[,"Carcinogen_liv"],exclude=NULL)
## exclude the controls (the ones with carcinogenicity status==NA)
DM1 <- DM[,!is.na(pData(DM)[,"Carcinogen_liv"])]
DM1$Carcinogen_liv <- droplevels(DM1$Carcinogen_liv)
table(pData(DM1)[,"Carcinogen_liv"],exclude=NULL)
## carry out (drastic) variation filtering
DM1000 <- variationFilter(DM1,ngenes=1000,score="mad",do.plot=FALSE)
dim(DM1000)
```

### Exploratory Data Visualization
After having uploaded and properly processed the data, we start by
visualizing them with a heatmap (see `Rmodule_heatmap.Rmd`).

```{r heatmap, fig.width=7, fig.height=10}
library(ggpubr)
library(cba)
library(gridExtra)
## plotting using heatmap.ggplot2
p1 <- heatmap.ggplot2(eSet=DM1000,
                      col.legend.brewer = "",
                      col.clust = TRUE, row.clust = TRUE,
                      col.clust.hc = NA, row.clust.hc = NA,
                      col.lab = c("Carcinogen_liv", "CHEMICAL"), row.lab = "",
                      heatmap.y.text = FALSE, heatmap.x.text = FALSE,
                      heatmap.colorlegend.name = "expression",
                      title.text = "Expression of top 1k MAD filtered genes",
                      col.legend.name = c("Carcinogen_liv", "CHEMICAL"),
                      row.legend.name = "",
                      row.scaling = "z-score.capped",
                      z.norm = FALSE,
                      cuttree.col = 0, cuttree.row = 0,
                      verbose = FALSE,
                      grid.heights =c(1,1.5,0.5,4,0.5,0.5,0.5)/sum(c(1,1.5,0.5,4,0.5,0.5,0.5)),
                      show = FALSE)
grid.arrange(p1)
```

## Classifying the Carcinogenicity Status of Compounds

### Data partitioning

Here, we perform the data partition into discovery and validation sets
(alternatively, into train and test sets).

We start by simplifying the phenotype labels.

```{r classify_1}
set.seed(3456) # for reproducible results

## some renaming to make data handling simpler
DM1000$CHEMICAL <- factor(DM1000$CHEMICAL)              # ensuring phenoype is a factor
DM1000$Carcinogen_liv <- factor(DM1000$Carcinogen_liv)  # ditto
levels(DM1000$Carcinogen_liv)[levels(DM1000$Carcinogen_liv)=="NON-CARC"] <- "noncarc"
levels(DM1000$Carcinogen_liv)[levels(DM1000$Carcinogen_liv)=="CARCINOGEN"] <- "carc"
table(pData(DM1000)[,c( "CHEMICAL", "Carcinogen_liv")]) # show composition
```

We then perform the _stratified_ partition, whereby stratified means
that both subsets should have a relatively equal representation of the
two classes ('noncar' and 'carc').

Also, notice that there is an additional level of complexity here,
because we have multiple replicates for each chemical. Hence, if we
were to carry out the split 'naively', we might end up with
representative of the same chemicals _both_ in the discovery and
validation set, which would not be appropriate (it would be
'cheating').

To address this issue, we carry out the partition at the _chemical_
level, rather than the _sample_ level. That is, we partition the
chemicals into a discovery and validation set, so that _all_ the
replicates of a given chemical will be assigned to either the
discovery or the validation set.

```{r classify_2}
## data partitioning into discovery and validation set
CHEMICALGROUP <- pData(DM1000)[!duplicated(pData(DM1000)$CHEMICAL),c("CHEMICAL", "Carcinogen_liv")]
discoveryCHEMICALindex <- createDataPartition(CHEMICALGROUP$Carcinogen_liv, p=0.6, list=FALSE, times=1)
discoveryCHEMICAL <- CHEMICALGROUP$CHEMICAL[discoveryCHEMICALindex]
validationCHEMICAL <- CHEMICALGROUP$CHEMICAL[-discoveryCHEMICALindex]

## split data into discovery and validation set (all replicates belong to one or the other)
DM1000discovery <- DM1000[,DM1000$CHEMICAL %in% discoveryCHEMICAL]
DM1000validation <- DM1000[,DM1000$CHEMICAL %in% validationCHEMICAL]

discovery <- data.frame(t(Biobase::exprs(DM1000discovery)))
discoveryLab <- factor(DM1000discovery$Carcinogen_liv, levels = c("noncarc", "carc"))

validation <- data.frame(t(Biobase::exprs(DM1000validation)))
validationLab <- factor(DM1000validation$Carcinogen_liv, levels = c("noncarc", "carc"))
```

### Model Fitting on the Training Set

We now fit a KNN classifier. We evaluate several versions, based on
different numbers of neighbors, and evaluate the performance of each
by 5-fold cross-validation (cv).

```{r classify_3}
## KNN with 5x cross validation
fitControl <- trainControl(method="cv",
                           number=5,
                           classProbs=T,
                           summaryFunction=twoClassSummary)
set.seed(1234) # for reproducible results

## evaluate on train set based on area under the ROC (AUC)
KNN <- train(x=discovery,
             y=discoveryLab,
             method="knn",
             trControl=fitControl,
             tuneGrid=expand.grid(.k=c(3,5,7,9,20)),
             metric='ROC')
## summary of performance across each value of tuning parameters
KNN
plot(KNN, metric = "ROC")

## show the parameters that yield the most accurate classifier (as estimated by cv)
KNN$bestTune

#final model used and performance across test sets of each fold
KNN$finalModel
```

**WARNING**: It should be noted that the internal cv performed by caret in
this case does not take into account the problem of multiple
replicates per chemical. Thus the cv estimates of accuracy (based on
AUC) will in general be over-optimistic. However, we will hope that
all the estimates will be equally over-optimistic, thus allowing us to
select the best model parameterization.

### Validation on the Test Set

After having selected the "best" classifier, we can now apply it to
the validation set.

```{r classify_4}
## predicting the validation data:
pred <- predict(KNN,validation)

## or predicting using the probabilities (nice because you can get ROC)
probs <- extractProb(list(model=KNN),
                     testX=validation,
                     testY=validationLab)

## removing trainings data
probs <- probs[probs$dataType!='Training',]

## Make sure the levels are appropriate for twoClassSummary(), ie case group is first level
levs <- c("carc", "noncarc")
probs$obs <- factor(probs$obs, levels = levs)
probs$pred <- factor(probs$pred, levels = levs)

## Calculating Accuracy
mean(probs$obs==probs$pred)

## see classification prob for each sample in validation set
## pred column shows model predicted label if cutoff for calling label = 0.5
table(probs$obs, probs$pred)

## summary of performance result on validation set
twoClassSummary(probs, lev = levels(probs$obs))
```

### Random Forest

#### Model Fitting on the Training Set

Next we fit a Random Forest classifier. We evaluate several versions, based on
different numbers of random features to be used for each tree, and evaluate the performance of each by 5-fold cross-validation (cv). Note, that a commonly features per tree is $\sqrt{total\; features}$, in this case $\sqrt{total\; features} = \sqrt{1000} \sim 32$.

```{r classify_5}
## RandomForest with 5x cross validation
fitControl <- trainControl(method="cv",
                           number=5,
                           classProbs=T,
                           summaryFunction=twoClassSummary)

set.seed(1234) # for reproducible results

## evaluate on train set based on area under the ROC (AUC)
RF <- train(x=discovery,
             y=discoveryLab,
             method="rf",
             trControl=fitControl,
             tuneGrid=expand.grid(mtry=c(32, 50, 100, 250, 500)),
             metric='ROC')
## summary of performance across each value of tuning parameters
RF
plot(RF, metric = "ROC")

## show the parameters that yield the most accurate classifier (as estimated by cv)
RF$bestTune

#final model used and performance across test sets of each fold
RF$finalModel
```

#### Validation on the Test Set

All of the classifiers work well on the training data.  A nice thing about Random Forests are that they're performance is fairly robust to different parameter choices  We'll end using use $\sqrt{total\; features} = \sqrt{1000} \sim 32$ , we can now apply it to the validation set.

```{r classify_6}
## predicting the validation data:
predRF <- predict(RF,validation)

## or predicting using the probabilities (nice because you can get ROC)
probsRF <- extractProb(list(model=RF),
                     testX=validation,
                     testY=validationLab)

## removing trainings data
probsRF <- probsRF[probsRF$dataType!='Training',]

## Make sure the levels are appropriate for twoClassSummary(), ie case group is first level
levs <- c("carc", "noncarc")
probsRF$obs <- factor(probsRF$obs, levels = levs)
probsRF$pred <- factor(probsRF$pred, levels = levs)

## Calculating Accuracy
mean(probsRF$obs==probsRF$pred)

## see classification prob for each sample in validation set
## pred column shows model predicted label if cutoff for calling label = 0.5
table(probsRF$obs, probsRF$pred)

## summary of performance result on validation set
twoClassSummary(probsRF, lev = levels(probsRF$obs))
```

### Support Vecor Machine (Linear Kernel)

#### Model Fitting on the Training Set

Next we fit a SVM classifier with a linear. We evaluate several versions, based on different cost parameters, and evaluate the performance of each by 5-fold cross-validation (cv). SVM attempts to separate each group by a hyperplane over all variables by maximizing the distance (or margin) between this hyperplane and the closest points to it. The cost parameter controls the leniency of certain points falling on the wrong side of this hyperplane if it means the margin of the hyperplane to other points to be greater. This is to control overfitting.  Large cost parameters don't allow for any points in the training data to be misclassified.

```{r classify_7}
## SVM with 5x cross validation
fitControl <- trainControl(method="cv",
                           number=5,
                           classProbs=T,
                           summaryFunction=twoClassSummary)

set.seed(1234) # for reproducible results

## evaluate on train set based on area under the ROC (AUC)
SVM <- train(x=discovery,
             y=discoveryLab,
             method="svmLinear2",
             trControl=fitControl,
             tuneGrid=expand.grid(cost=10^(seq(-4.5, -3, by = 0.05))),
             metric='ROC')
## summary of performance across each value of tuning parameters
SVM
plot(SVM, metric = "ROC")

## show the parameters that yield the most accurate classifier (as estimated by cv)
SVM$bestTune

#final model used and performance across test sets of each fold
SVM$finalModel
```

#### Validation on the Test Set

```{r classify_8}
## predicting the validation data:
predSVM <- predict(SVM,validation)

## or predicting using the probabilities (nice because you can get ROC)
probsSVM <- extractProb(list(model=SVM),
                     testX=validation,
                     testY=validationLab)

## removing trainings data
probsSVM <- probsSVM[probsSVM$dataType!='Training',]

## Make sure the levels are appropriate for twoClassSummary(), ie case group is first level
levs <- c("carc", "noncarc")
probsSVM$obs <- factor(probsSVM$obs, levels = levs)
probsSVM$pred <- factor(probsSVM$pred, levels = levs)

## Calculating Accuracy
mean(probsSVM$obs==probsSVM$pred)

## see classification prob for each sample in validation set
## pred column shows model predicted label if cutoff for calling label = 0.5
table(probsSVM$obs, probsSVM$pred)

## summary of performance result on validation set
twoClassSummary(probsSVM, lev = levels(probsSVM$obs))
```
