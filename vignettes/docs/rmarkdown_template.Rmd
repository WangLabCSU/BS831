# Section 1

## Subsection 1.1

```{r code.chunk, cache=FALSE} 
## cache=TRUE can be used with chunks where heavy computation is
## performed, so that if you need to 'recompile' the cached results of
## that chunk will be reused. However, not sure how 'smart' Rstudio is
## at detecting whether "upstream changes" have occurred.

## Setting a variable to show its reference outside a chunk
N <- 20
```

If you want to reference a variable outside a code chunk, you can use 
the inline construct. E.g., the variabel `N` has value `r N`.
